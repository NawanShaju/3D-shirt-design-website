# 3D-shirt-design-website

This website leverages Three.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS to create an interactive platform for designing custom T-shirts. Users can personalise their shirts by choosing different colors and uploading images from their computers, which can be applied as logos or background designs.
The site makes extensive use of Three.js to render and manipulate a 3D model of the T-shirt, providing a dynamic and immersive design experience. Tailwind CSS is utilised for styling, enabling inline CSS properties directly within HTML tags for efficient and streamlined development.
